* Big O:
- Define "Time complexity and space complexity"
helps when making trade offs between space and time
- Find out time/space complexity of different algorithms

linear f(N) => f(N) = N
quadractic f(N) => f(N) = N"2
constant f(N) => f(N) = 1 
sth completely different 


- Linear algorithm: O(2*N) is equivalent to O(N)
- Polynomi algorithm:
